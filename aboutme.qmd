# Introduction

Hi, my name is Nicolas Puglisi. I have recently completed my Master of Science degree in mathematics from Virginia Tech (VT) in May 2024. I completed my undergraduate degrees in mathematics and statistics at the University of Georgia in May 2022. I am currently seeking employment, and I am excited to apply my model building skill set and gain additional experience in the real-world with messy data.

### Why Mathematics & Statistics?

My love for mathematics began when I took Calculus 1 while dually enrolled with a local college as a rising senior in High School. At the time, I thought I would go on to study engineering or chemistry in college, but I instantly fell in love with the problem-solving, challenge, and intuition of mathematics. During my orientation at UGA, I spoke with the statistics program's undergraduate advisor and was convinced to add an additional major. As a result, studying mathematics and statistics in tandem has given me an immense appreciation for the rich theory and application of model-building and data analysis skills. My studies have empowered me to become a critical thinker and skilled analyst who can work in many settings and collaborate with all.

### Background

-   To conclude my M.S. degree, I researched and defended a thesis validating the forecasting performance of mathematical infectious disease models using data from the 2015-2016 Zika virus epidemic in Colombia. I have been interested in predictive modeling for many years, and became interested in epidemic forecasting after learning more about mathematical modeling from my M.S. program.
-   During my graduate studies, I was a teaching assistant for multiple math classes in Virginia Tech's mathematics department. I held weekly recitation lectures for undergraduate students in MATH 1025, and also assisted instructors of record with grading homework and exams. I was also supported in my second year as a research assistant to explore forecasting strategies of infectious disease models and defend my thesis.
-   My coding experience is predominantly in R and MATLAB. I have experience working in R Markdown and tidyverse, Python with Pandas and Matplotlib, GitHub, Microsoft Office, and SQL.
-   I have leadership and time management experience through my role as Vice President of the UGA fencing club.

### Future Goals

I am seeking to start a career where I intend to gain industry experience, utilize my critical thinking skills, and hone my technical knowledge and analytical skills. I hope to be part of a collaborative environment with like-minded people who strive for excellence. In the future, I would like to improve my mathematical and statistical modeling techniques to apply them to a myriad of problems, both for uncovering trends and forecasting.    

### Hobbies

I cherish time spent with friends and family over home-cooked meals. I love sharing new board games with people, especially strategy games. One would most likely find me in the kitchen tinkering with a recipe or meeting new people at a coffee shop.
